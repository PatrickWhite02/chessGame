# chessGame

This is a very simple chess game, featuring online and local multiplayer support.

<br>This is my first foray into online gaming, so I learned loads about running sockets and threads, which I had also never encountered.

<br> I made this project as a part of my concussion recovery, so I was fairly rusty going into it and had to take long breaks, but I have been able to gradually increase the number of hours a week I am able to work through making this.

To learn how to handle servers in code, I followed <a href = "https://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/how-to-create-a-chat-console-application-in-java-using-socket" target = "_blank"> this tutorial</a> on making a simple chat server, which I then adapted to fit this project's needs. If anyone else is trying to learn Java socketing I strongly recommend it.
