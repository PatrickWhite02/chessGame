BUGS
||straight piece can't move to top left corner
||white pawn can't take on side columns at all, black can't take on right column
I'm suspicious of index out of bounds when pieces reach the end of the board, especially pieces that have hard move deltas that aren't in for loops. Kings and knights are the only ones I think

If i  make an edit in branch 2, merge it to main, make an edit on branch 3 then merge it to main, will I lose branch 2 edit? No, if they conflict then intellij will tell me and give me options

:: should be resolved but haven't fully tested
